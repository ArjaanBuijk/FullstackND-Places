# Neighborhood Map

Portfolio project to demonstrate a single page application featuring a neighborhood map with interesting locations.

The application is written using the [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library to easily associate  HTML DOM elements with the model data in the javascript functions and to automatically update the UI when the model data changes.

The application demonstrates the integration of 3rd party APIs:

- [Google Maps](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/), to visualize a neighborhood and it's places
- [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/explore), to show an interesting venue when a location is clicked.



Attractive styling and intuitive responsive behavior on all devices are implemented with [bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/).



# Usage

The neighborhood page can be found in: static/index.html

Just open it up in your browser, and all should be self explanatory.



# Deployed on Heroku

The application is also deployed on  [https://knockout-neighborhood.herokuapp.com](https://knockout-neighborhood.herokuapp.com)
